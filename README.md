# NewtonRalphson

## Summary
Independent Project to implement a Newton-Ralphson one-dimension minimisation. In this project, I write my own version of Newton-Ralphson's optimization in one-dimension. While existing libraries, such as scipy, already has optimize as a method that is readily avaliable, it is good practice to write my own version to understand the concept of it.
